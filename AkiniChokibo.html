        An exotic Naga food item that you can devour is Akini Chokibo prepared with perilla seeds and snails. The adventurous foodie in you will thank us for this recommendation because it is very delicious! It is such a melt-in-mouth dish (owing to the pork lard added to its preparation) that you will surely go back for more. The distinct characteristic of Naga cuisine reflects well in this food item and you can easily get to try some at a local eatery.
