        No, that thing you ordered in the restaurant last time was not Dum Aloo. If you want to savor the real authentic Kashmiri cuisine, you should take a trip and have Dum Aloo Kashmir food style. The baby potatoes are cooked in yogurt, ginger paste, fennel, and hot spices. Just the aroma of this simple dish is appetizing. Have it with roti or naan bread.
