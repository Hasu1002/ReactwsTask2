        A Kongunadu speciality from the town of Pallipalayam, this traditional dry chicken dish packs a punch. As is typical in Kongu cuisine, the meat is never marinated. The dish champions local ingredients. Chunks of chicken are fried in minimal oil with shallots, garlic, chillies, and ribbons of coconut. Best paired with rice and rasam for a wholesome, snooze-inducing lunch. Try it at: Haribhavanam, known for serving Kongunadu cuisine.
