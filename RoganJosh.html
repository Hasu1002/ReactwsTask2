        Rogan Josh has to be the first mention in Kashmir food. The delicious signature dish has put Kashmir on the food map. Rogan Josh is an aromatic lamb curry made with the fusion of various spices, yogurt, and browned onions. A healthy low-fat dish, it is best savored with rice or naan bread. If you are non-vegetarian, you wonâ€™t be able to stop yourself at one serving of one of the best Kashmiri dishes.
