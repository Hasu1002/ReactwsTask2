        One of the most relished Naga dishes you can try in any part of the state is Rosep Aon. A simple yet wholesome dish consisting of boiled vegetables and dry fish, it goes perfectly well with some Naga rice, chutney, and salad. Do not go by how “basic” this Nagaland food item might sound because the melody of eggplants, beans, ladyfingers, mustard leaves, and several other seasonal vegetables with fermented dry fish defines comfort food.
