        Nagaland and smoked pork have a special bond that has been carried on by various tribes spread across the state. The main reason behind smoking pigs is for creating food security in the harsh winter months when the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables is difficult. Samathu is a lip-smacking curry made using smoked pork pieces, fermented soybean, bamboo shoot vinegar, pepper, chilli flakes, garlic, ginger, etc. If you can befriend a Sema tribe family who prepares this dish for you at their home, then it will be an experience that you will never forget!
