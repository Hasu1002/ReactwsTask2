        Shab Deg is a forgotten Kashmiri delicacy that triggers nostalgia with the mention of its name alone. Any Kashmiris reading this will understand. Shab Deg is a meat delicacy cooked overnight with patience and richness of ingredients. Shab means night and Deg is a large cooking vessel. A rooster is cooked with turnips and spices overnight to bring out the right flavors in the dish and the vessel is sealed with dough. It is a special dish made for large families or when you are having people over.
