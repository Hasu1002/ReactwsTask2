        A homestyle rice-and-lentil dish, this age-old recipe is a quick one-pot creation found in most homes, often served with rasam, pickles, papad, and curd. After a long day, a meal of rice and toor (pigeon pea) dal tempered with mustard seeds, onions, and garlic is like a warm hug in a bowl. Try it at: Pavizham Restaurant, known for its simple, hearty fare.
