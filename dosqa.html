        The next famous food of Mysore, Neer dosa, is popular due to its light texture. Unlike Mysore masala dosa and other types of dosas in South India, Neer dosa is known for its lack of fermentation and simple cooking method. It is made with two basic ingredients, including rice flour and salt. Thin and soft, Neer dosa, can be served with sambhar, coconut chutney, saagu, and many non-vegetarian dishes like Kori Gassi, mutton, and egg curries.
