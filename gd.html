        You know it’s going to be a good day when it begins with a fresh-off-the-griddle dosa, paper-thin and crisp as the summer sun. Bonus points if it’s doused in ghee and folded into a towering cone. Coimbatore’s menus are packed with roast dosa options: onion, potato masala, rava (semolina), and more. Whatever your pick, scoop it up with tangy sambar, coconut chutney, and green coriander chutney. Try it at: Sree Annapoorna, an iconic eatery with several branches across the city.
