        A dish that is loved by everyone in Mysore, Idli is made by steaming the batter of fermented rice and black lentils. Soft and fluffy, these steamed rice cakes are a perfect dish if you want to have something lighter and calmer for your taste buds. While Idlis are the most famous breakfast option in South India, especially Mysore, you can find people enjoying them as snacks throughout the day. Mysore Idlis are served with broth, sambhar, and chutney. The tangy and spicy flavour of the broth varies, giving you the best texture with the combination of soft idlis.
